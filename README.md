# Three-Body-Orbit
Plots created from this program illustrate the orbit of a satellite orbiting the Earth with gravitational forces influencing it from both the Earth and Moon. We are observing the motion of the satellite in the rotating reference frame which is done by taking into account the centrifugal and Coriolis force within the equation of motion
